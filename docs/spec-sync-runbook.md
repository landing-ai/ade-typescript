# spec-sync runbook

Operational guide for whoever is on point for this SDK: what to watch, what to decide, and who picks
it up after you merge.

The **mechanism** — how the pipeline is built, what each gate checks, why the token cannot be
`GITHUB_TOKEN` — lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#spec-sync-pipeline). This file is only
the part a human has to do. `ade-python` carries the mirror of this runbook; the two SDKs are
maintained as a pair and most decisions here apply to both.

## The loop in one paragraph

`Spec Sync` runs hourly (`.github/workflows/spec-sync.yml`, cron `0 * * * *`). When the live
**staging** spec drifts from the committed snapshot, it opens one PR on a fixed branch
(`spec-sync/v1` or `spec-sync/v2`) and announces it in Slack. You review and merge it — the wiring
commit is AI-drafted and **always** needs human review. Merging publishes nothing: QA tests merged
`main` against staging first, and a maintainer dispatches the release only after the API has reached
production.

## 1. Where the signal is: `#ade-sdk-pipeline`

Every spec-sync message goes to **`#ade-sdk-pipeline`** (the default channel in
`.github/actions/slack-notify/action.yml`), and messages are **threaded**: the "PR opened" message is
the thread root and everything afterwards is a reply under it. The root's `ts` is persisted in the PR
body by `scripts/spec-sync/thread-ts.sh` so later runs and the lifecycle workflow can find the
thread.

**The channel looks quieter than it is — open the threads.** Only the "PR merged" reply broadcasts
back to the channel.

V1 and V2 are independent loops with their own PRs and their own threads. Every message title says
which one (`spec-sync V1:` / `spec-sync V2:`).

| Slack message                              | Fired by                                     | What you do                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `new spec drift → PR opened` (thread root) | `spec-sync.yml`, right after the PR exists   | Nothing yet — the AI wiring commit is still being written. |
| `AI wiring …` (result)                     | `spec-sync.yml`, after the AI step           | Review the PR. See §2.                                     |
| `new drift behind the open PR`             | `notify-new-drift.sh`                        | Decide: merge or close. See §3.                            |
| `gates failed on the sync PR`              | `spec-sync-lifecycle.yml` (PR Gates failure) | Fix or close — it cannot merge until green.                |
| `sync PR open N days`                      | daily aging sweep, 16:00 UTC                 | Clear it. See §4.                                          |
| `PR merged — spec back in sync`            | `spec-sync-lifecycle.yml`                    | Hand off to QA. See §5.                                    |

Silence is also information — but not always: an unavailable staging spec source (unbooked cluster → 404) is a deliberate **no-op with no Slack alert**, so "no messages" can mean either "no drift" or
"staging is unbooked". A staging cluster that stays unbooked for days silently stops all drift
detection. If the channel has been quiet for an unusually long stretch, check that staging is booked
before assuming the spec is stable.

## 2. Reviewing a drift PR

The PR arrives as up to two attributed commits — a mechanical snapshot, then the AI wiring (which may
legitimately be absent for workflow-only drift). `.github/copilot-instructions.md` spells out what is
and is not in review scope; the short version:

- **Do not review** `specs/v2-aide.json`, `specs/v1-ade.json`, or anything under `specs/_generated/`.
  They mirror the upstream spec verbatim and cannot be fixed here.
- **Do review** everything hand-maintained the PR touched: `src/`, `tests/`, `api.md`, `README.md`,
  `docs/`.
- If the PR changes public surface, the **api-report** gate needs a regenerated report committed:

  ```sh
  yarn api-extractor
  ```

  Watch the line endings — the report body is CRLF but the closing fence must be LF, matching `main`.

- **The AI step cannot run anything.** The V1 step is allowed `Bash(git diff:*)` and nothing else;
  the V2 step has no shell at all. Neither can run lint, format, or tests, so no wiring commit here
  was ever verified locally by the agent. (`ade-python` differs: its V1 step _does_ have a shell and
  is told to run `./scripts/format` and `./scripts/lint`.)
- Check what CI cannot: optionality that disagrees with the spec's `required`, and model-pinned
  smoke tests. Invented URL paths _are_ caught for `client.v2` by `check-v2-paths.sh` in the `lint`
  job — but **not** for V1 resources, so check those by hand.
- Cross-SDK parity on hand-written top-level params (`password`, `strict`, `grounding`) has **no gate
  at all** — it has to be diffed against `ade-python` by hand. CONTRIBUTING's "V2 request fields"
  section has the rules and the incident that produced them.

## 3. New drift arrives while a sync PR is open

**Why this happens:** `check-drift.sh` compares the live spec against `main`, not against the PR
branch. So while a sync PR is open, every hourly tick still reports drift. `notify-new-drift.sh`
suppresses that noise — it compares the live spec against the _PR branch's_ snapshot, stays silent
when the PR already covers it, and otherwise pings once per distinct live spec (deduped by content
hash in a sticky PR comment).

When you get that ping, the open PR is a snapshot of _earlier_ drift and is now stale. Two options,
both fine:

**Option A — close the PR, take the next one.** Pick this when the PR has not been reviewed yet, or
when the AI wiring looks wrong and the newer drift probably supersedes it. Nothing is lost: the next
run re-derives everything from the live spec.

**Option B — merge the PR, take the rest next round.** Pick this when the PR is already reviewed and
correct. You ship it as a stepping stone and the next PR covers the remainder.

Either way, the next spec-sync run opens a fresh PR covering what is left. **You do not have to wait
for the top of the hour** — Actions → **Spec Sync** → Run workflow triggers it immediately (the
`concurrency` group serializes it against the cron tick, so a manual dispatch is always safe).

What not to do: leave it open and hope. Drift piles up behind it, the aging nudge starts, and the
eventual PR is a much larger AI diff to review.

## 4. Aging nudge

`scripts/spec-sync/aging-nudge.sh` runs in the daily 16:00 UTC sweep and replies in the PR's thread
once it has been open **3 days** (`MIN_AGE_DAYS`), then at most every **3 days** after that
(`MIN_GAP_DAYS`). It is a reminder, not a gate — nothing auto-closes. Treat a second nudge as a sign
to take Option A in §3.

## 5. After merge: QA, then release

**Merging publishes nothing.** That gap is deliberate — it is the QA window ("staging in, production
out"):

1. **You** merge the sync PR.
2. **You** post in **`#ade-release`** and ping **`@qa_team`** (Slack user group, ~7 QA members) that
   `main` has new SDK surface to validate.
3. **QA** installs merged `main` and tests it against staging, while nothing is published:

   ```sh
   yarn add "github:landing-ai/ade-typescript#main"
   export LANDINGAI_ADE_ENVIRONMENT=staging
   ```

4. The API reaches **production**.
5. A maintainer dispatches Actions → **Release** → Run workflow and picks the bump
   (patch / minor / major). Dispatching **is** the release decision — there is no release PR and no
   second confirmation. The workflow stamps the version, prepends the changelog, pushes
   `release: x.y.z` to `main`, tags it, and creates the GitHub Release, which triggers
   `publish-npm.yml`.

**A red release is usually not a bug.** The Release workflow's gate 0 is the full V1 + V2 e2e suite
against the **live production API**, and nothing downstream runs if it goes red. Two ordinary causes:
the SDK ships surface that has not reached production yet, or production is having an incident. Both
are the gate doing its job. Shipping during a genuine production incident requires temporarily
removing gate 0 from `release.yml` — a deliberate act, documented at the top of that file.

Both release gates sit before any commit, tag, or GitHub Release exists, so an aborted release leaves
nothing to clean up.

## 6. Secrets and access to take over

All in repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions unless noted. The two tokens marked **person**
are currently personal PATs — that is why spec-sync PRs are authored by their owner — and they must
be reissued by whoever takes the repo over.

| Secret                            | Used by                                             | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A GitHub App installation token is the cleaner long-term replacement.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Also must not be `GITHUB_TOKEN`: releases it creates do not trigger `publish-npm.yml`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `LANDINGAI_ADE_PRODUCTION_APIKEY` | `e2e-production.yml` (release gate 0)               | **Environment secret on `production-e2e` only — do not also store it as a repo secret**, which every branch can read and which defeats the branch rule. Under that Environment's "Deployment branches and tags", restrict to **`main`**: that rule, not the workflow's `if`, is the real control — a `workflow_dispatch` runs the selected ref's copy of the workflow file, which could drop the `if`. Unlike the staging Environment, do **not** add required reviewers here: `release.yml` blocks on this job, so every release would pause for a manual approval. |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`                 | `.github/actions/slack-notify`                      | `xoxb-…`. Threading exists **only** on this path. Must be in `#ade-sdk-pipeline`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Flat, no threading — and **not a general fallback**: `spec-sync-lifecycle.yml` (gate failures, aging nudge, PR merged) passes only the bot token, so a webhook-only setup silently loses those three messages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**npm publishing has no secret.** `bin/publish-npm` uses npm **OIDC Trusted Publishing**
(`--provenance`, `id-token: write`), so the trust lives on npmjs.com, not here: the package's trusted
publisher must point at this repository and the `Publish NPM` workflow. Transfer the npm org
membership and re-check that configuration as part of the handoff — it is the one piece that is
invisible from inside the repo.

Not a secret but part of the handoff: the **required reviewer** on the `spec-sync-staging` Environment is a named person too (`production-e2e` deliberately has none — see its row above).
`production-e2e` Environments are named people too.

## 7. Known gaps — do not mistake these for bugs

- **`release-gate.sh` is not wired.** `scripts/spec-sync/release-gate.sh` implements the
  staging-in/production-out route check (every `(path, method)` in the staging snapshot must exist in
  the production spec) but **nothing calls it** — `release.yml`'s only production gate is the e2e
  suite. Same in `ade-python`. Before wiring it, note two real problems: it compares the _whole
  staging snapshot_, not the routes the SDK actually implements, so an unwired compat route that has
  not reached production would block releases; and it is V1-only (both the snapshot path and the
  production URL are hardcoded).
- **V2 workflow parity.** This SDK ships `client.v2.workflow` / `workflowJobs` as a hand-maintained
  surface: the `/v2/workflow*` routes stay in the tracked spec (so spec drift there still opens a
  mechanical PR as a signal) but the AI-wiring step excludes them, and a maintainer reconciles them
  by hand. `ade-python` does **not** implement `/v2/workflow*` at all. The two SDKs are genuinely not
  at parity here.
- **Cross-SDK alias parity has no gate.** See §2 and CONTRIBUTING's "V2 request fields" section. A
  gate for this was built and then deliberately removed; the prompt and CONTRIBUTING are the only
  enforcement, and comparison is by hand.
