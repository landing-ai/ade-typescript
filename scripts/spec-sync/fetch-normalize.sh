# (see the client-surface PR). Stripping them during normalization keeps them out of the committed
# snapshot, so spec-sync's AI wiring never sees them and cannot re-add the hidden surface. To
# un-hide, remove this filter and re-wire the resource. NOTE: V1 `/v1/ade/extract/build-schema` is
# deliberately NOT stripped — only the V2 surface is hidden.

# A 200 with an empty/whitespace body would make `jq` emit nothing and exit 0 — a silent "empty spec"
# that check-drift would treat as drift and commit, clobbering the snapshot. Reject it loudly instead.
