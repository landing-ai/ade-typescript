# `del(...)`: the V2 build-schema endpoints are intentionally hidden from the SDK
# (see the client-surface PR). Stripping them during normalization keeps them out of the committed
# snapshot, so spec-sync's AI wiring never sees them and cannot re-add the hidden surface. To
# un-hide, remove this filter and re-wire the resource. NOTE: V1 `/v1/ade/extract/build-schema` is
# deliberately NOT stripped — only the V2 surface is hidden.

# Capture + validate: a 200 response with an empty/whitespace body would otherwise make `jq`
# emit nothing and exit 0 — a silent "empty spec" that check-drift would treat as drift and commit,
# clobbering the committed snapshot. Reject empty output loudly instead. (Malformed JSON already
# fails via jq's non-zero exit under pipefail.)
