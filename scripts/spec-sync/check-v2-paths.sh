# Cross-check the V2 resource sources against the committed V2 spec snapshot, in BOTH directions:
#
#   1. Every URL path a V2 resource sends (a quoted `/v2/...` or `/v1/...` literal) must exist under
#      `paths` in the snapshot. This catches a wired route the spec does not have. It is the exact
#      failure of landing-ai/ade-python#153: the spec added /v1/classify and /v1/split (V1-compat
#      routes of the AIDE gateway), and the AI-wiring pass "translated" them into client.v2.classify
#      / client.v2.split hitting /v2/classify and /v2/split — paths that exist nowhere. Staging 404'd
#      and the contract gate went red, but nothing said WHY until a human read the spec.
#   2. Every `/v2/*` path in the snapshot must be sent by some V2 resource. This catches a new /v2
#      route the wiring pass skipped. A route that is deliberately not wired goes in DEFERRED below,
#      or is stripped from the snapshot in fetch-normalize.sh (how build-schema is hidden).
#
# Path parameters compare structurally: `{job_id}` in the spec, `{job_id}` in a Python f-string and
# `${jobID}` in a TypeScript template literal all normalize to `{}`.
#
# Runs in `./scripts/lint` (so the CI `lint` job enforces it on every PR) and inside the spec-sync
# workflow's lint step, where a failure is fed back to the AI repair pass. It only READS source:
# grep + jq over files, nothing is imported or executed — so it is safe to run over AI-authored code
# in a trusted step, like eslint/tsc.
