# Best-effort: append an LLM-written "## What changed" summary of the actual PR diff to a spec-sync
# PR body, under the static process/safety preamble (which stays authoritative). Shared by the V1
# and V2 jobs in .github/workflows/spec-sync.yml; the only per-job difference (the V2 workflow
# exclusion) is passed via SUMMARY_SCOPE_NOTE.
#
# Usage: summarize-pr.sh <pr-url>
# Env (required): GH_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Env (optional): SUMMARY_MODEL (default claude-sonnet-5), SUMMARY_SCOPE_NOTE (extra instruction)
#
# A summary is nice-to-have: any API/network hiccup degrades to leaving the static body untouched
# and exits 0. Missing args/secrets exit non-zero so a wiring bug in the workflow is not silent.
# NOT set -e: we handle failures explicitly so a transient error never clobbers the body.
